# WIP

This project is a *work in progress*. The implementation is *incomplete* and
subject to change. The documentation can be inaccurate.

# Synopsis

This is a draft of a ls of a board using MRAA (tested in Raspberry Pi 3).

# Example once compiled:

       $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
       $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
       $
       $ ./ls_mraa
